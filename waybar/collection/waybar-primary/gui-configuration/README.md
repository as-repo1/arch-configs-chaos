This is my Arch Linux GUI Config and Scripts.
I use [rofi](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi) as my application launcher, and [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland) as my window manager.

Make sure to add chrome folder to firefox from the extra/chrome
Make sure to have beta sideberry with it's css also in extra/chrome/sideberry.css add this in extension settings

# Note

#### Gammastep
It relies on geoclue2 for location.
it will only fetch the location if `/usr/lib/geoclue-2.0/demos/agent` is running in background
`gammastep -l geoclue2` will make the system turn on gamma based on location.
make sure to run `gammstep-indicator` for ui reference control

### Power system
install `pm-utils` that will expose `on_ac_power` and then you can use `waybar/bin/battersaver-toggle` to control power

### Wine & Lutris
[wine deps](https://github.com/lutris/docs/blob/master/WineDependencies.md)

xstow links to the parent dir (make sure to read help)
keep in mind to give the args `-t ~` no matter where you are cloning

# Waybar
`waybar/bin/start.sh` executes waybar and injects string in config so that only shown on one monitor.
make sure to modify to your needs

# MAYBE
if only using fzf.zsh or a single module and keymaps not working then you must be using `zsh-vi-mode`
